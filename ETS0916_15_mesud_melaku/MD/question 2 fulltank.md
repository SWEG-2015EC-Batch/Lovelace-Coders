problem analysis

input(s): the capacity of the fuel tank in gallons(capacity) and the miles per gallon that the automobile can be driven(milesPerGallons).

output(s): the number of mile that the automobile can be driven without refueling(miles).

procedure(s):

--> declaring a variables named capacity, milesPerGallon, refulingMiles that are used for the operation

--> prompt a message that instruct the user to give information about the capacity of the fulltank and the amount of miles that it can travel per gallon.

--> read the capacity and the amount of miles per gallon that the automobile can be driven

--> calculating the number of miles using the formula miles = capacity * milesPerGallon

--> displaying the number of mile that the automobile can be driven without refueling

algorithm/psedocode

step 1: start

step 2: read the capacity and milesPerGallon of the automobile

step 3: miles = capacity * milesPerGallon

step 4: print miles

step 5: stop
