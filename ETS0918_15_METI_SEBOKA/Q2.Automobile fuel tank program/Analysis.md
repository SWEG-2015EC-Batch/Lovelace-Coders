# Problem Description:

Write a program that calculates and displays the number of miles an automobile can be driven without refueling. The program should prompt the user to enter the capacity in gallons of the automobile's fuel tank and the miles per gallon the automobile can be driven. It should then calculate the total number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling using the formula:

Total miles = capacity in gallons * miles per gallon

The program should then display the calculated total miles.

# Analysis

Input: capacity and miles per gallon
Output: The distance possible without refueling

## Pseudo code

  ### Step 1:start
  
  ### Step 2:read the capacity
  
  ### Step 3:read the miles per gallon
 
  ### Step 4:compute the possible distance
    Distance = capacity * miles per gallon
  ### Step 5:print the Distance
  
  ### Step 6:stop

# operation
 
- Prompt user for fuel tank capacity and miles per gallon
- Read the values of capacity and miles per gallon
- Calculate the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling using the formula: miles = capacity * miles per gallon
- Display the calculated number of miles

## Design the program

## 1. Variable declaration and initialization (What and How?)
 ### double capacity, MPG, Pd;

## 2. Reading input data (How?)

 ### cout << "Please enter the automobile’s fuel gas tank capacity: ";
 ### cin >> capacity;
 ### cout << "Please enter the miles per gallon for the automobile: ";
 ### cin >> MPG;

## 3. Perform operation - compute the Possible distance without refueling(How?)

### Pd = MPG * capacity;

## 4.Print result (Distance). (How?)
### out << “The automobile can go a distance of  ” << Pd << “ miles without refueling.”;
