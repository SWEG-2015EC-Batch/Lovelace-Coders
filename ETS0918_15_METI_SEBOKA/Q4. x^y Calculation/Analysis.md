# problem description

write a program that prompts the user to enter the values of x and y. Then, the program should calculate and display the result of x raised to the power of y using the pow() function from the cmath library.

# Analysis

Input: x and y (two numbers one base and one power)
Output: x raised to y (x^y)

# operation

- Prompt user for the values of X and Y
- Read the values of X and Y
- Calculate the result of X^Y using the pow() function
- Display the calculated result

# Pseudo code
  
  Step 1: start
  Step 2: read x
  Step 4: read y
  Step 5: calculate x^y
  Step 5: print the result
  Step 6: stop

# Design the program

1. Variable declaration and initialization (What and How?)
 int x, y, z;

2. Reading input data (How?)
 
 cout << "Please enter the number to be powered: ";
  cin >> x;
 cout << "Please enter the power: ";
  cin >> y;

3. Perform operation - (How?)
  z= pow(x, y);

4. Print result (X^y). (How?)
  cout << x << " the power of " << y << " is " << z;
